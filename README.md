# Mancala

This is the implementation of the boardgame Mancala. The game cannot be played yet, because the GUI is still in development. The game logic has been implemented using Object Oriented design and Test-driven development. 
It is a 2 player game with the objective to capture more stones than the opponent. The Mancala board consists of 6 Pockets and 1 Kalaha for each player. the SuperPocket is an abstract class from which the Pocket and Kalaha both inherit from. 
At the start of the game, all Pockets contain 4 stones which will be passed along to the other pockets in order to get as many stones as possible in the Kalaha. The game ends when one of the players has no more stones in their pockets.
